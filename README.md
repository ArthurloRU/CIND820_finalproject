## The dataset used for this project:

Yelp Dataset

This dataset is a subset of Yelp's businesses, reviews, and user data. It was originally put together for the Yelp Dataset Challenge which is a chance for students to conduct research or analysis on Yelp's data and share their discoveries. In the dataset you'll find information about businesses across 11 metropolitan areas in four countries.

In total, there are :
* 5,200,000 user reviews
* Information on 174,000 businesses

This dataset contains a total of seven CSV files.
